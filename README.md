=====

A Music sequencer inspired in [TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal), the idea came after reading this:[Controling Live Music](https://joearms.github.io/published/2016-01-27-Controlling-Live-Music.html) and this: [Controlling sound with OSC Messages](https://joearms.github.io/published/2016-01-29-Controlling-Sound-with-OSC-Messages.html).

the main ideas are:

- Creating a distributed environment for connecting livecoders around the world, sharing different ideas and ways of programming.
- Esoteric programming, the weirdness and dark world of erlang.
- Attemp simpler logics and setup.
